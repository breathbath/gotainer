1. Fail container if declaration without new func or constructor func is declared:
		container.Node{
			Id: "service",
			ServiceNames: container.Services{
				"dep1",
				"dep2",
				"dep3",
				"dep4",
			},
			GarbageFunc: func(service interface{}) error {
				return service.(MyThing).Destroy()
			},
		},
2. Container should not construct dependencies when resolving events on build time
3. It would be nice to change some dependencies at runtime like
cont.Set as when using cont.AddNewMethod/AddConstructor for the same service id the duplication
detector will complain
